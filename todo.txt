+ Check if datasets are created correctly, push them
+ Create simulation vs return (and discounted) for both cartpole and frozenlake
+ Create histograms
+ Do regression for both
	+ For cartpole divide it into simulation and simulation + initial_state
+ Look into regression models
	+ Draw learning curves
	+ Can we use quadratic regression for cartpole with initial state?
	+ Can we do discriminant analysis or PCA
	+ What are the hyper-parameters for regression models
+ Get 500 returns for a certain simulation. Scatter plot the pole angle vs pole angular velocity
+ Try to draw a 3d plot for pole angle x pole angular velocity x return at a certain simulation
