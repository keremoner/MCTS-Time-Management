# Meeting

## Points of action
- Go over the results for FrozenLake and Cartpole
    - Sim vs Return graph
    - Simulation Histograms
    - Regression results
    - Learning Curve
- Dataset size?
- Regression algorithms and hyper-parameters
- Cluster script and efficiency

## Action points for next week 
- Check MCTS implementation - CartPole results
- Write all of the results as a document
- Check regression models - quadratic
- Use learning curve to decide on dataset size
- Subtract true mean from the MSE to have a graph that goes to zero as dataset size increases
- FrozenLake try with different maps
- Cartpole, try with different parameters
- Check supervised learning approach for having multiple datapoints with same features
